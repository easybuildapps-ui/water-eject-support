<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><small>Last updated: December 10, 2025</small></p>

<p>Water Eject ("we", "us", "our") provides a mobile application available on a freemium basis. This Privacy Policy explains what information may be collected when you use the app, how it is used, and what rights you have as a user.</p>
<p>By using the app, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We do not ask you to create an account in the app and we do not request your name, email address or phone number inside the app.</p>

<p>While you use the app, the following categories of data may be collected automatically:</p>

<p>If you make in-app purchases or activate a subscription, the app may process the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>information about the purchase or subscription status;</li>
  <li>purchase receipts needed to verify access to paid features and restore purchases;</li>
  <li>technical data necessary to validate transactions, prevent fraud and detect billing issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

<p>We may use the collected information to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide, operate and maintain core functionality of the app;</li>
  <li>enable and manage in-app purchases and subscriptions, including receipt validation and restoring access to purchases;</li>

  <li>detect, prevent and address technical issues, abuse or violations of terms;</li>
  <li>compile aggregated, anonymized statistics about usage of the app.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not use the collected information to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies and we do not sell your data to third parties for advertising purposes.</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>To support purchases, subscriptions, analytics and campaign measurement, the app may integrate third-party services that process data on our behalf. These services may, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>validate purchase receipts and manage subscription status;</li>
  <li>provide aggregated analytics about how users interact with the app and paywalls;</li>
  <li>measure the effectiveness of user acquisition and marketing campaigns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such providers may process technical data such as device information, usage events and purchase-related data strictly for the purpose of operating their services for us. They are required to handle data in accordance with applicable privacy and security requirements.</p>

<h2>4. Legal Basis (where applicable)</h2>

<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, our legal basis for processing information may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>performance of a contract, for example to provide access to purchased features;</li>
  <li>legitimate interests, for example to maintain and improve the app, prevent fraud and abuse;</li>

<h2>8. Data Security</h2>

<p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information processed in connection with the app and to minimize the risks of unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.</p>

<h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
